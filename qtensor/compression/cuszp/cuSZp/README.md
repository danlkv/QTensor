cuSZp is a user-friendly error-bounded lossy compression tool specifically designed for the compression of single- and double-precision floating-point data using NVIDIA GPUs. 
This tool fuses all compression or decompression computations into one single kernel, achieving ultra fast end-to-end throughput.
Specifically, the cuSZp framework is structured around four pivotal stages: Quantization and Prediction, Fixed-length Encoding, Global Synchronization, and Block Bit-shuffling. 
Noting that ongoing optimization efforts are being devoted to cuSZp, aimed at further improving its end-to-end performance.

## Environment Requirements
- Linux OS with NVIDIA GPUs
- Git >= 2.15
- CMake >= 3.21
- Cuda Toolkit >= 11.0
- GCC >= 7.3.0

## Compile and Run cuSZp Prepared Executable Binary
You can compile and install cuSZp with following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZp.git
$ cd cuSZp
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install/ ..
$ make -j
$ make install
```
After compilation, you will see a list of executable binaries ```cuSZp/install/bin/```:
- ```cuSZp_cpu_f32_api```: single-precision, host pointers (i.e. on CPU).
- ```cuSZp_gpu_f32_api```: single-precision, device pointers (i.e. on GPU).
- ```cuSZp_cpu_f64_api```: double-precision, host pointers (i.e. on CPU).
- ```cuSZp_gpu_f64_api```: double-precision, device pointers (i.e. on GPU).

To use those binaries, try following commands. 
We here use RTM pressure_2000 dataset (1.4 GB, 1008x1008x352) for single-precision example, and NWChem acd-tst.bin.d64 (6.0 GB) for double-precision example.
```shell
# Example for single-precision API
# ./cuSZp_gpu_f32_api TARGET_HPC_DATASET ERROR_MODE ERROR_BOUND
#                                        ABS or REL

## Using cuSZp as an Internal API
This repository provides several examples for using cuSZp compression and decompression for different scenarios (device pointer? host pointer? f32 or f64?).
The examples can be found in ```cuSZp/examples/```.
Assuming your original data, compressed data, and reconstructed data are all device pointers (allocated on GPU), and the data type is single-precision. The compression and decompression APIs can be called as below:
```C++
// For measuring the end-to-end throughput.
TimingGPU timer_GPU;

// cuSZp compression.
timer_GPU.StartCounter(); // set timer
SZp_compress_deviceptr_f32(d_oriData, d_cmpBytes, nbEle, &cmpSize, errorBound, stream);
float cmpTime = timer_GPU.GetCounter();

// cuSZp decompression.
timer_GPU.StartCounter(); // set timer
SZp_decompress_deviceptr_f32(d_decData, d_cmpBytes, nbEle, cmpSize, errorBound, stream);
float decTime = timer_GPU.GetCounter();
```
